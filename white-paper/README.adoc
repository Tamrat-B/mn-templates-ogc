= White Paper template in AsciiDoc

== General

White Papers have no set structure, so organize the content as best fits your purposes

== Content

This GitHub repository contains the content for an OGC White Paper.

* `document.adoc` - the main White Paper document with references to all sections
* remaining ``adoc``s - each section of the White Paper document is in a separate document
** follow directions in each document to populate
* figures - figures go here
* images - Image files for graphics go here. Image files for figures go in the `figures` directory. Only place in here images not used in figures (e.g., as parts of tables, as logos, etc.)
