== Clauses not Containing Normative Material

Paragraph

=== Clauses not containing normative material sub-clause 1

Paragraph

General Principles: 

- Flat representation (similar to 3DCityDB & CityJSON) -> not really profile
- Semanticall Thin (link to external sources, rather than copyying in)
- Avoid Reduancy (if better sources are usually available, i.e. terrain, road)
