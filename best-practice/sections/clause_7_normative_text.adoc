The CityGML Best Practice Guidance document provides an overview of how various CityGML modules align with the CityGML Standard.

CityGML encompasses several modules. The overall CityGML data model is thematically decomposed into a CityGML core module and extension modules. Each module is
defined within its own globally unique XML namespace. Due to this modularization approach, there are various versions of valid CityGML
documents are not valid CityGML 1.0.0 instance documents. As a result the Best Practice Guidance documents details varying levels of support:

- **Core CityGML Module**: This module is partially supported due to the implementation challenges associated with NURBS and ExternalReferences, which contribute to fragmentation. Despite these challenges, features like Implicit Geometries are supported.
  
- **Appearance Module**: Support is partial because it does not accommodate the TexCoordGen class, which requires UV coordinates in texture files.

- **Fully Supported Modules**: The following modules are fully supported: Bridge, Building, CityFurniture, Construction, Generics, LandUse, Transportation, Tunnel, Vegetation, and WaterBody.

- **CityObjectGroup Module**: This module is partially supported. It supports groups of City Objects but does not extend to sub-groups, such as walls within a building.

- **Unsupported Modules**: The following modules are not supported:
  - **Dynamizer**: Issues include the lack of support for semantically thin Dynamizer systems.
  - **PointCloud**: No current support is provided.
  - **Tin**: Support is impractical due to constraints with Delaunay triangulation.
  - **RasterRelief**: Only TINRelief/TriangulatedSurface is supported; alternatives for unsupported formats are suggested.
  - **Versioning**: Relies on a git-based approach similar to CityJSON.

The document also notes that database solutions are specific, and alternative methods are recommended for formats like RasterRelief that are not supported.

|CityGML module |Compliant? |CityJSON inspired

|Core|PARTIAL|NURBS are not supported, Implicit Geometries are supported .ExternalReferences are not supported.
|Appearance|PARTIAL| the CityGML class TexCoordGen is not supported, ie one must specify the UV coordinates in the texture files.
|Bridge|YES
|Building|YES	 
|CityFurniture|YES	 
|CityObjectGroup|PARTIAL|groups of City Objects are supported, but not groups of parts of objects (eg it is not possible to group some walls of a building together)
|Construction|YES|	 
|Dynamizer|NO|Semantically thin, dedicated systems
|Generics|YES	
|LandUse|YES	 
|PointCloud|NO
|Relief|TBd|only the TINRelief/TriangulatedSurface is supported. 
|Tin|NO|(where only elevation points and break lines are stored) is not supported since it would require viewer/applications to have a constrained Delaunay triangulator, which is problematic (especially for web-based tools). Also, it is not possible to store areas over a terrain that would support different resolutions. 
|RasterRelief|NO|is also not supported -> other, better formats?
|Transportation|YES	 
|Tunnel|YES
|Vegetation|YES	 
|Versioning|NO|CityJson using git based approach
|Database|specific solutions?
|WaterBody|YES
