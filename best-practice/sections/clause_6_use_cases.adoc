Required Modules: Buildings

Benefititial Modules: Appearance

LOD: High

To guide the long-term development of urban areas, balancing land use, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability.
To assess and optimize the spatial arrangement of residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational areas, as well as transportation networks, utilities, and green spaces.
In urban planning, the focus is on developing strategies to manage the growth and development of cities in a way that meets the needs of current and future populations while ensuring environmental sustainability. This involves comprehensive planning of land use, zoning, transportation, and the integration of various urban systems. The use of 3D models aids planners in visualizing the entire urban environment, understanding how different components interact, and simulating potential outcomes of different planning scenarios. This allows for informed decision-making and helps in balancing competing needs like housing, infrastructure, and green space.

Relevant thematic modules in CityGML for this use case include:

Building (for the visualization and analysis of existing and planned buildings, their heights, densities, and potential land use)
LandUse (to manage and plan the zoning of different areas for residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational purposes)
Transportation (to model transportation networks, including roads, railways, and public transport systems, supporting planning of efficient movement and connectivity)
Relief (to incorporate topography and terrain data, which influences planning decisions related to construction, drainage, and infrastructure)
Vegetation (to plan and integrate green spaces, parks, and tree coverage within urban areas, promoting sustainability and enhancing quality of life)
CityFurniture (to plan the placement of urban elements such as benches, lighting, and public facilities that improve the livability of spaces)


=== Simulation & Analysis

==== Sight & Shadow Analyis



==== Solar Potential & Solar Irradiance

The estimation of the solar potential for roofs and facades is an often cited application for 3D City Models and many cities ....




==== Daylight Simulations
In some countries, Daylight simulations are part of the urban planning or building permit process. 

* To assess the impact of a new construction on daylight in existing buildings in the neighborhood
* To assess if requirements for daylight are met in a new buildings

The latter is usually conducted using architectural tools, using a detailed 3D model of the building in question (i.e. BIM) and less detailed models of the surrounding context. In this case, the 3D City Model only serves as a source for context and does not require detailed information on rooms or windows.

The first case typically includes the calculation of solar irradiation at window level of surrounding buildings. 
This requires information about the position and size of the the windows. Currently, most cities do not have this information available for existing (older) buildings. 


Relevant Modules: Buildings
Required Information: Windows




==== Noise Simulation
Noise Simulations become increasingly important as part of the urban planning process. The simulation input is usually noise sources and obstacles from which  the propagation of noise is calculated.

3D City models are a useful foundation for the calculation of noise propagation as they include physical obstacles (buildings, sound barriers, vegetation) and potentially also include information about the acoustic properties of horizontal and vertical surfaces (hard vs soft surfaces). 

While possible (i.e. Dynamizers) Noise sources are usually not stored as part of the 3D City Model and are derived from other sources (i.e. road database, which includes speed limits, surface material and traffic count). 

The calculation of the noise propagation is performed in a dedicated software. An ETL process, combining different sources and preparing a suitable input format for the software is required.
For performance benefits, a lower LOD of the city model is usually preferred.


→ requires semantic information about hard vs soft surfaces
→ requires informatio about speed limit etc on street → external reference

Relevant Modules: Building, Vegetation, Transport, CityFurniture (Walls), Relief?
Relevant Properties: Acoustic Surface Properties

[TODO]
====
More information needed on the relevance / desire to use surface properties. Maybe, in practice, this is not relevant and can be simplified. 
====



==== Flood Simulation
In some locations, flood simulations are an essential part of urban planning and emergency precaution.

The main  input to the simulations are terrain and 3D objects (i.e. buildings).
For more accurate calculations, information on ground roughness and infiltration capacity (permeable vs impermeable) are required. 

While the simulation could theoretically be ran on a 3D City Model, the common hydorological models and simulation softwares rely on homogenous and continous raster DTMs as input. 

These are in practice derived from a rasterized top view of the 3D objects (i.e. Buildings) combined with a DTM and (if applicable) additional raster layers describing surface coverage and permeability.


Required Modules: Building, CityFurniture, Relief
Optional Modules: Vegetation




==== Urban Climate Indicators


This use case is commonly applied in urban design and planning to understand the environmental effects of urban form, building materials, vegetation, and street layout. The simulation typically models how elements like building density, orientation, and green spaces influence the local microclimate, such as heat distribution, airflow, and sunlight exposure. By analyzing the interaction between buildings and the surrounding environment, urban planners can identify areas susceptible to overheating, poor air circulation, or uncomfortable wind conditions, enabling them to design more climate-resilient urban spaces.

* To assess the impact of urban development on local microclimates, such as temperature variation, wind patterns, and air quality.

* To evaluate how new construction or changes to urban infrastructure affect the comfort, livability, and sustainability of the urban environment.

Relevant thematic modules in CityGML for this use case include:

* Building (for detailed 3D geometry and materials, which influence heat absorption and wind flow)

* Vegetation (to model green spaces that impact air quality and temperature regulation)

* Relief (to account for terrain and topography, which can affect wind patterns and heat distribution)

* CityFurniture (to represent urban elements like trees, benches, and shelters that contribute to microclimate conditions)

*Transportation (to model roads and their effect on urban heat islands and airflow)



=== Urban Heat Island Effect Assessment (combine with above?)
To assess the impact of urbanization on local climate conditions, particularly the urban heat island effect.
To identify areas of the city that are more susceptible to extreme heat and recommend mitigation strategies.
The urban heat island effect occurs when urban areas experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings due to human activities and the built environment. 3D city models help simulate temperature variations across the city, taking into account factors like building materials, vegetation, and heat-emitting infrastructure. This can guide decisions related to urban design, green spaces, and energy-efficient building strategies.

Relevant modules in CityGML:

Building (for analyzing the effects of building materials and urban density on heat retention)
Vegetation (for evaluating the cooling effect of parks, trees, and other green spaces)
Relief (to assess how the city's topography influences heat distribution)
CityFurniture (for considering how small-scale urban elements like pavements and streetlights contribute to heat)



==== First Response (Indoor )

* To assist firefighters and emergency responders in navigating buildings during emergency situations, such as fires, ensuring efficient and safe operations.
* To provide real-time, spatially accurate information about building layouts, exits, hazards, and key infrastructure to improve response times and reduce risks.
In the first response use case, the goal is to equip emergency responders with detailed building information that can help them navigate quickly and effectively during high-pressure situations. Accurate and up-to-date 3D models of buildings can provide real-time data about building layouts, fire exits, hazardous materials, and emergency systems such as sprinklers, elevators, and ventilation. This allows firefighters to plan their routes more effectively, assess risks, and make informed decisions on the spot, improving both safety and efficiency in emergency operations.

Relevant thematic modules in CityGML for this use case include:

Building (to provide detailed 3D geometry of building structures, including rooms, corridors, staircases, and entry/exit points, which is essential for navigation during emergencies)
BuildingPart (to represent individual floors, rooms, and sections of a building, enabling responders to locate specific areas and identify potential hazards such as storage rooms or chemical hazards)
BuildingInstallation (to include critical infrastructure like fire alarms, sprinkler systems, ventilation shafts, and electrical panels that need to be accessed or disabled during a fire emergency)
CityFurniture (to map exterior elements like hydrants, access points, and street furniture that aid in emergency response outside the building)
Relief (to incorporate terrain and topography information that can influence accessibility to the building, especially in multi-story or uneven terrain environments)



==== Facility Management of Buildings

* To manage the lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure, ensuring efficient maintenance, operation, and optimization of resources.
* To monitor and assess the condition of building components, systems, and equipment for timely interventions, repairs, or upgrades.

This Use Case is not in the scope of this Best Practice as it focuses on single buildings. While it is theoretically possible to use CityGML, it is recommended to rely on BIM (IFC) models for this use case.
While CityGML is focused on urban scale and context, IFC is better suited for managing the detailed, technical data required during construction and lifecycle management of buildings.


[TODO]
====
this requires further investigation, IFC more suitable

==== 3D Cadastre
* To manage, visualize, and assess ownership, land use, and legal rights over three-dimensional parcels of land.

* To facilitate the registration of complex property boundaries, including underground and above-ground spaces, and resolve conflicts between overlapping land rights.

In the context of 3D cadastre, the goal is to extend traditional 2D land registries to include the full vertical and underground dimensions of urban space. This is especially relevant in dense urban environments, where buildings, utilities, and infrastructure often span multiple levels or go underground. The 3D cadastre use case supports the creation of legal and ownership boundaries for both above-ground and sub-surface spaces, such as air rights, underground utilities, and property extensions like balconies or rooftops. It also aids in resolving conflicts between adjacent properties and facilitating the legal management of complex land use scenarios.

Relevant thematic modules in CityGML for this use case include:

* Building (to define the vertical extent and boundaries of buildings and their ownership, including roof and basement spaces)
* BuildingPart (to represent individual building components, such as floors or rooms, which may have different owners or legal statuses)
* LandUse (to define the land use and zoning regulations, supporting the management of property rights in accordance with urban planning)

Optional/TBD
* Transportation (for defining rights of way and boundaries of roads or public transportation infrastructure that may intersect or overlap with private properties)

=== Conclusion (Qualitative)

* Buildings ist most used Module in the CityGML Data Model for 3DCIM applications
* 2nd Level Building features (Rooms, Storey) are not yet widely used in practice, but cities are planning to use it and use cases have been described
* Semantic Surface Information (especially "windows") are required for certain Simulation applications and improve the results of others. However, currently most existing 3D city models do not contain semantic information on surfaces. Some models do differentiate between "Roofs" and "Walls", but not "windows". This is mostly due to the fact that aquiring this information requires either a semantically correct BIM model as a source (for newer buildling), or an established workflow to derive this information from other sources (i.e. photogrammetry, street images)

* Some use cases require information that are usually stored in dedicated systems, (i.e. traffic, demographics), rather than maintaining a semantically thick data motdel, real world applications suggest the use of external references
* Simulation which requires surface semantics often requires specific file format as input, hence a convertion is needed
