= Release Notes template in AsciiDoc

This GitHub repository contains the content for the Release Notes for the revision of an OGC standard.

The repo is organized as follows:

* document.adoc - the main document content
  - organized in multiple sections
  - this is the only part needed to create a release notes document

Special thanks to Jeff Yutzler for developing this example for this template.
